# 8051_GUI
GUI for programming of c8051 target devices on Linux

# Usage
This project is created using Qt Creator and should be compiled as such.

This project is ONLY INTENDED to work for Linux systems. Specifically my own Linux system. Feel free to try it if you want a simple GUI for developing on 8051's but YMMV

Usage of this GUI requires both sdcc and an ec2 debugger driver.

Get sdcc: http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

Get the ec2 driver: https://github.com/paragonRobotics/ec2-new

# Notes
This project is targeted towards the c8051 boards utilized in LITEC and MPS at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute #LetsGoRed
